# Todo List App

This todo list app has a slick minimalist design that let's the user easily work and organize their lives. This project features a light/dark theme toggle and also lets users reorganize their todos with drag and drop.

The users todos are kept in LocalStorage for easy access and persistance among re-loads so their work is never lost.
